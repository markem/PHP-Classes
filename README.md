My PHP Classes
This is a set of classes that I have been developing for years. If you find them interesting - great. If you use them - great. Each class has a license with it. It is a license I put together from several sources and I did that because I liked what those licenses had to say about programs that are given away. It is called the BSD-3-Patent license. Please see and read one of the licenses.

Each class works on one idea. So class_ansi deals with ANSI commands. Class ansicon handles a program a gentleman in Australia wrote (ie: ansicon) and the class handles running the program and interfacing with the class. One of the locations you can get ansicon.exe from is https://www.npackd.org/p/ansicon/1.89. If you search via Google (or DuckDuckGo or any other web search engine) you can find multiple places with the software.

I am not much for writing documentation - except inside of each class itself. There you will find a one or two sentence long blurb on what the class or function does. You can write me at markem@sim1.us. I will do what I can to answer you. Thanks for using my software.
