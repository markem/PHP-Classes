following conditions are met:

1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above

2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the

following disclaimer in the documentation and/or other
materials provided with the distribution.

3. Neither the name of the copyright holder nor the names
of its contributors may be used to endorse or promote

written permission.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each
copyright holder and contributor hereby grants to those
receiving rights under this license a perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except for failure to satisfy the conditions of this
license) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to
sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,
where such license applies only to those patent claims,
already acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by
such copyright holder or contributor that are necessarily
infringed by:

(a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of
copyright holders and non-copyrightable additions of
contributors, in source or binary form) alone; or

(b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work
of authorship to which such Contribution(s) was added by
such copyright holder or contributor, if, at the time
the Contribution is added, such addition causes such
combination to be necessarily infringed. The patent license
shall not apply to any other combinations which include
the Contribution.

Any and all works whether derivatives or extensions or
whatever should be sent back to markem@sim1.us.  In this
way, anything that makes these routines better can be
incorporated into them for the greater good of mankind.
All additions and who made them should be noted here
in this file OR in a separate file to be called the
HISTORY.DAT file since, at some point in the future, this
list will get to be too big to store within the class
itself.  If there is a standard on such things - see the
BSD license file for details.  If you do not agree with the
license - then do NOT use these routines in any way, shape,
or form.  Failure to do so or using these routines in whole
or in part - constitutes a violation of the BSD licensing
terms and can and will result in prosecution under the law.

An example follows on what should be included in your
manuals, and in your program, and shown while your program
is being run.

	Please note that _MY_ Legal notice for each class
	is as follows:

	<PUT CLASS NAME HERE>. A class to <What it does>.
	Copyright (C) 1992-NOW.  By Mark Manning.
	All rights reserved except for those given by the
	BSD License.

	Please place _YOUR_ legal notices _HERE_. Thank you.

Except as expressly stated above, no rights or licenses
from any copyright holder or contributor is granted under
this license, whether expressly, by implication, estoppel
or otherwise.

Note that contributions to me can be made at
sim_sales@sim1.us via PayPal. YOUR ARE NOT REQUIRED
to make a contribution - it is just if you want to do
so. Because this is not noted anywhere else, I decided to
put it here. Please DO NOT send more than 1% of whatever
software it is you are selling or maybe a $1.00. Thank you
in advance if you do send anything to me. Comments (like
"You suck!" or "Great Software!") can be sent to either
email addresses. Nasty comments will get dumped into the
bit bucket. Nicer comments will be responded to as I can
do so. Not that I am busy - I'm retired, lazy, and may or
may not feel like responding. (But I usually do.)
